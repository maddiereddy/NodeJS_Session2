<!--Example of a closure in which the outer function (outerMultipy) has a parameter that is used
by the inner function (innerMultiply) which also has a parameter. The operation performed by the
inner function is to return multiplication of both the parameters value. The closure function is called and
 an alert displays the multiplication produced by the closure-->

<script>
    function outerMultiply(param1){
        var innerMultiply = function (param2){
            alert("Multiplication of outer param " + param1 + " and inner param " + param2 + " is " + (param1 * param2));
        }
        return innerMultiply;
    }
    var closureFunc = outerMultiply(12);
    closureFunc(8); //accessing the inner function using closures
